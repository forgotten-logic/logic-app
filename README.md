## The App

**Forgotten Logic** is a puzzle game app; in its current form its main feature is an 8-tile sliding number puzzle, though there is infrastructure in place for more logic puzzles to be added.

While it may not seem so, there are actual health benefits that logic puzzles provide. They stimulate intricate parts of the brain that
do not usually get exercised, encourage systematic thinking, boost brain activity and are pivitol in child development.

## Resources Used

Our animations come from [Animate.css](https://animate.style) - the script is included in the HTML files.

The tile movement map is based on Danish Mughal's [Sliding Puzzle](https://github.com/danishmughal/sliding-puzzle).
